### Data Preparation

The dataset chosen for this analysis is a raw dataset of Alzheimerâ€™s disease patients, consisting of 10 columns and 374 rows. The dataset exhibits inconsistencies and redundancies that can impact algorithm accuracy. Prior to evaluating machine learning algorithms, it is crucial to clean the data by addressing redundancy, missing values, and unwanted attributes.

The provided Python code is a comprehensive data preprocessing script tailored for Alzheimer's disease prediction.

1. **Import Essential Libraries:**
   - The script begins by importing essential libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and scikit-learn's StandardScaler for data standardization.

2. **Load and Handle Missing Values:**
   - The dataset is loaded from a specified file path, and missing values in numeric columns are filled with the mean, rounded to one decimal place.
   - **Figure 1.2:** Filled missing values in the dataset

3. **Create Gender Indicator Column:**
   - A gender indicator column is created, replacing the original 'M/F' column.
   - **Figure 1.3:** Gender indicator in the dataset

4. **Bin Age Values:**
   - Age values are binned into groups ('60-70', '70-80', '80-90', '90-100'), and a new column 'Age Group' is added.
   - **Figure 1.4:** Age Group column added into the dataset

5. **Filter Rows and Round Numeric Columns:**
   - Rows where the 'Group' column is labeled 'Converted' are filtered out, focusing on Demented and Nondemented groups. Selected numeric columns ('nWBV', 'ASF', 'SES', 'CDR') are rounded to three decimal places for clarity.

6. **Standardize eTIV Column Using Z-Score Normalization:**
   - The 'eTIV' column is standardized using Z-score normalization.
   - **Figure 1.5:** eTIV column after Z-score normalization process

7. **Display Updated DataFrame and Export to CSV:**
   - Finally, the updated DataFrame is displayed, and the modified dataset is exported to a new CSV file named 'data_alzheimer.csv'.

This script encapsulates a range of preprocessing techniques, setting the stage for subsequent analysis and machine learning model training in Alzheimer's disease prediction.
